# Senior Research Project

## Developing a Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification to Break Image Selection CAPTCHA

The goal of this senior research project is to create a model that classify images of cars in order break modern CAPTCHA security measures. The expected outcomes of this project are an image classification model, a better understanding of machine learning, and insights into how to improve CAPTCHA security measures for websites.
